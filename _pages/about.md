## About Me

Hello! I'm **Hanning Lin**, a Master of Analytics student at **UC Berkeley**, with a dual bachelor's degree in **Information Science** and **Econometrics & Quantitative Economics** from the **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign**. I also minored in **Computer Science** and **Statistics**.

My academic and professional interests lie in **machine learning fairness**, **quantitative modeling**, and **data-driven policy impact**. I have conducted research on algorithmic bias mitigation, including a project that achieved a **28.8% increase in fairness** and **45.9% improvement in model accuracy** for gender bias detection in education datasets — currently under review at the *EDM Conference 2025*.

Professionally, I've interned as a **Quantitative Analyst** at **KY Capital**, where I built predictive models with **neural networks** and **random forests** to forecast option volatility using over **12,000 financial entries**. At **China Life**, I developed **macroeconomic risk models** with pipelines handling **20,000+ rows**, simulating financial stress scenarios and disaster resilience using **Lasso regression** and SQL pipelines.

I also enjoy building useful tools — from a **U.S. Air Quality Dashboard** to a **Pet Adoption Website**, I’ve created full-stack applications combining **data visualization**, **REST APIs**, and clean design.
