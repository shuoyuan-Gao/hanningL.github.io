## About Me

Hello! I'm **Hanning Lin**, a graduate student in the **Master of Analytics** program at the **University of California, Berkeley**, with a strong background in **Information Science, Econometrics, and Quantitative Economics** from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

My work lies at the intersection of **machine learning fairness**, **statistical modeling**, and **data-driven decision-making**. I have research experience in **unfairness mitigation** for ML algorithms and have conducted large-scale experiments analyzing gender bias across real-world educational datasets. My goal is to build trustworthy and transparent AI systems.

Previously, Iâ€™ve worked as a **Quantitative Analyst Intern** at KY Capital, where I applied **neural networks** and **ARIMA** time series forecasting on financial market volatility, and at **China Life**, where I engineered macroeconomic risk models with **SQL pipelines** and **Lasso regression**.

Iâ€™m also passionate about building interactive data tools â€” like my **U.S. Air Quality Dashboard** and a **Pet Adoption Web App** â€” which blend front-end development with backend analytics.
